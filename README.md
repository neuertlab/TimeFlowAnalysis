# TimeFlowAnalysis
Automated analysis of time dependent flow cytometry data

## Description
Mammalian cells respond to stimuli differently depending on the concentration and rate of exposure. Understanding how stimuli dynamics influences cellular signaling is crucial in mapping the cellular response and requires rigorous analysis at multiple time points. Flow cytometry is an established method to study signal transduction in single cells by the means of antibody staining, allowing for parallel staining of multiple markers to quantify the signaling dynamics. In addition, fluorescent cell barcoding (FCB) allows for the sampled time points and replicate experiments to be multiplexed and pooled together minimizing the experimental error and variations in antibody staining resulting in high quality data sets. We developed TimeFlowAnalysis, a computational pipeline of barcoded time dependent flow cytometry data. TimeFlowAnalysis can automatically select specified cell populations, demultiplex barcoded flow cytometry samples, generate histograms of markers of interest at each time point, combine replicate experiments, generate replicate statistics, and compare different markers and experimental conditions to each other. With TimeFlowAnalysis, the temporal dynamics of an activated signaling cascade can be rigorously and efficiently investigated.
